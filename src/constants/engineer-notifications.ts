/**
 * Real Supabase-backed Engineer notification content (Japanese). See
 * src/lib/engineer/notifications.ts (public.notifications, 013_notifications.sql).
 *
 * Deliberately separate from src/constants/notifications.ts / src/components/notifications/*:
 * those are still shared with the (out-of-scope this phase) Company
 * notifications mock page (src/app/company/notifications/**), so they are
 * left untouched rather than being converted in a way that would break
 * Company's still-mock UI.
 *
 * type is the real 4-value enum (chk_notifications_type) -- there is no
 * "スカウト"/"面接"/"内定"/"システム" category in the real schema, so those
 * mock categories are dropped rather than fabricated. The table has exactly
 * one real producer today (private.notify_new_message(), a trigger fired on
 * new chat messages) -- application_received / application_status_changed /
 * opportunity_closed have no producer yet (would require changes to the
 * Company/Admin-side update paths, out of scope this phase), so this page
 * will honestly show no notifications of those types until that exists.
